Lambda Calculus

Question 1: 
    Not = \a.(a (False) (True))
    = \a.(a (\x(\y.y)) (\x(\y.x)))





Question 2:
    Lambda expession for ¬(¬p ? ¬q) when let a = p and b = q is: 
    NOT (NOT p AND NOT q)

    Write this expression in prefix position, we have:
    NOT (AND (NOT p NOT q))
    = \a.(a (False) (True)) (\a.(\b.(ab)a) (\a.(a (False) (True)) p \a.(a (False) (True)) q))
    = (a (False) (True)) [a := (\a.(\b.(ab)a) (\a.(a (False) (True)) p \a.(a (False) (True)) q))]
    = (\a.(\b.(ab)a) (\a.(a (False) (True)) p \a.(a (False) (True)) q)) (False) (True)
    = (\a.(\b.(ab)a) (\a.(a (False) (True)) p \a.(a (False) (True)) q)) (False) (True)
    = (\a.(\b.(ab)a) ((a (False) (True))[a:= p] (a (False) (True)) [a:=q])) (False) (True)
    = (\a.(\b.(ab)a) ((p (False) (True)) (q (False) (True)))) (False) (True)
    = ((\b.(ab)a) [a = (p (False) (True))] (q (False) (True))) (False) (True)
    = (\b.((p (False) (True))b)(p (False) (True)) (q (False) (True))) (False) (True)
    = (((p (False) (True))b)(p (False) (True)) [b:= (q (False) (True))] ) (False) (True)
    = (((p(False)(True)) (q(False)(True))) (p(False)(True))) (False) (True)
Let this be (1)

We also have (2):
* True True True 	
       = (\x.(\y.x)) True True 
       = x [x := True] [y := True] 
       = True
* False False False 
       = (\x.(\y.y)) False False 
       = y [x := False] [y := False] 
       = False
* False True False
       = (\x.(\y.y)) True False 
       = y [x := True] [y := False] 
       = False
* False False True
       = (\x.(\y.y)) False True 
       = y [x := False] [y := True] 
       = True
From (1) there are 4 cases of p and q which is simpler to solve by substitute (2) in:	

    Case 1: p = False and q = False
    (((False(False)(True)) (False(False)(True))) (False(False)(True))) (False) (True)
    = ((True) (True) (True) ) (False) (True)
    = False 

    Case 2: p = True and q = False 
    = (((True(False)(True)) (False(False)(True))) (True(False)(True))) (False) (True)
    = ((False) (True) (False)) (False) (True)
    = True

    Case 3: p = False and q = True 
    = (((False(False)(True)) (True(False)(True))) (False(False)(True))) (False) (True)
    = ((True) (False) (True)) (False) (True)
    = True

    Case 4: p = True and q = True 
    = (((True(False)(True)) (True(False)(True))) (True(False)(True))) (False) (True)
    = ((False) (False) (False)) (False) (True)
    = True

In summary, by grouping these cases and comparing them to OR (p ? q) as the truth table below, we can make the conclusion that both of them are equivalent.
pq¬(¬p ? ¬q)(p ? q)TTTTTFTTFTTTFFFF




Question 3:
    = (\xy.x)(\abc.cab)z(\z.zz)
    = (\xy.x)[x:=\abc.cab]z(\z.zz)
    = (\y.(\abc.cab))z(\z.zz)
    = ((\abc.cab))[y:=z](\z.zz)
    = (\abc.cab)(\z.zz)
    = (\bc.cab)[a:=\z.zz]
    = \bc.(c(\z.zz)b)

Blockus (Question 10)


We can use The Principle of Mathematical Induction theorem to prove a 2^n×2^n Blockus board with northwest corner removed can be covered with V3 pieces (3 blocks). 
Logically, by removing 1 block out of 2^n×2^n Blockus board we can have:
2^n×2^n-1 (blocks)
Moreover, to make sure that all V3 pieces can cover the whole board, we need the board is not contained a straight line of at least 2 blocks so that it can fit at least 1 V3 piece (fortunately, 2^n  ×2^n   is always a square so that not necessary) and the number of remaining blocks is divisible by 3:
?(2?^n×2^n-1) ?3 (blocks)
Let P(n)? ?(2?^n×2^n-1) ?3
Where base case is: 
P(0)? ?(2?^0×2^0-1) ?3 ? 0 ?3  ?T. 
Induction Hypothesis:
Assuming that P(n)=T in P(n)?P(n+1) and showing P(n+1) is a consequence of P(n):
P(n+1)? ?(2?^(n+1)×2^(n+1)-1)?3 
Starting with the left-hand side of the expression:
(?(2?^n×2^n )×(2^1  × 2^1) -1)
=4 ×?(2?^n×2^n) -1 (1)
Using the induction hypothesis, we already know that ?(2?^n×2^n-1) is divisible by 3. Therefore, the expression can be written as:
?(2?^n×2^n) -1=3×m, where m is an arbitrary integer.
??(2?^n×2^n) =3×m+1 (2)
Substituting (2) into the equation (1) gives:
=4 ×(3×m+1) -1
=12×m+3
Thus, ?(2?^(n+1)×2^(n+1)-1) is equal to an integer m multiply by 3 which also divisible by 3.
For instance,



From n = 1

To n +1, which n = 2
By the principle of mathematical induction, we have proved that ?(2?^n×2^n-1) is divisible by 3 for all positive integers n. Finally, there is always true that there is exist at least one order of V3 piece(s) that the square 2^n×2^n Blockus board with northwest corner removed can be covered with it.
